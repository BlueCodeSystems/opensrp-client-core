# Updated Commit and Release Commands - No Emojis

## Updated /commit Command Behavior

### Current Behavior (with emojis)
The current `/commit` command sometimes uses emojis in commit messages and includes emoji attributions.

### Proposed Update (no emojis)
```bash
# Instead of:
ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

# Use:
Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
```

### Updated Commit Message Templates

**Feature commits:**
```
feat: add user authentication system

- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow

## Implementation Updates Needed

### 1. Commit Command Updates
```typescript
// Remove emoji from attribution
const CLAUDE_ATTRIBUTION = "Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)";

// Remove emojis from commit message templates
const commitTemplates = {
  feat: "feat: {description}\n\n{details}\n\n{attribution}",
  fix: "fix: {description}\n\n{details}\n\n{attribution}",
  chore: "chore: {description}\n\n{details}\n\n{attribution}"
};
```

### 2. Release Command Updates
```typescript
// Update tag message template
const tagMessageTemplate = `
Release v{version} - {project_name}

{release_description}

{sections}

BREAKING CHANGES:
{breaking_changes}

Full changelog: {changelog_url}
`;

// Section headers without emojis
const sectionHeaders = {
  features: "NEW FEATURES:",
  changes: "CHANGES:", 
  fixes: "BUG FIXES:",
  dependencies: "DEPENDENCIES:",
  breaking: "BREAKING CHANGES:"
};
```

### 3. Progress Indicators
Instead of emoji progress indicators, use text-based ones:

```
Current: üöÄ Starting migration...
Updated: [INFO] Starting migration...

Current: ‚úÖ Build successful
Updated: [SUCCESS] Build successful  

Current: ‚ùå Tests failed
Updated: [ERROR] Tests failed

Current: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Breaking changes
Updated: [WARNING] Breaking changes detected
```

## Benefits of Removing Emojis

1. **Professional Appearance**: More suitable for enterprise and professional environments
2. **Better Compatibility**: Works across all terminals, IDEs, and git clients
3. **Consistent Rendering**: No issues with emoji rendering differences
4. **Screen Reader Friendly**: Better accessibility for visually impaired developers
5. **Plain Text Parsing**: Easier for automation tools to parse commit messages
6. **Universal Support**: Works in all environments regardless of unicode support

## Updated /migrate-android Command Output

The migrate-android command should also be updated to remove emojis:

**Before:**
```
üöÄ Android Migration Complete!

‚úÖ Phases Completed:
üì¶ Publishing Ready:
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
```

**After:**
```
Android Migration Complete!

PHASES COMPLETED:
PUBLISHING READY:
IMPORTANT NOTES:
```

## Configuration Option

Consider adding a configuration option to allow users to choose:

```json
{
  "commits": {
    "useEmojis": false,
    "attributionStyle": "plain"
  },
  "releases": {
    "useEmojis": false,
    "tagMessageStyle": "professional"
  }
}
```

This would allow users to opt into emoji-free commit and release messages while maintaining backward compatibility for those who prefer the current style.
