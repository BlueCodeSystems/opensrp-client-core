## Command Variations

### Dry Run Mode
```bash
/migrate-android --dry-run --group-id=io.github.bluecodesystems
```
Shows all planned changes without applying them.

### Skip Build Phase  
```bash

```
Useful for large projects where you want to review changes before building.

### Conservative Migration
```bash
/migrate-android --version=6.1.5 
```
Minimal version bump, no group ID change, focused on build system only.

### Full BlueCode Integration
```bash
/migrate-android --group-id=io.github.bluecodesystems --version=6.2.0
```
Complete migration including BlueCode Systems branding and dependencies.
